# drawings

This is an approach for collaborative digital drawing. Anyone who is interested
is invited to fork this repo and add his ideas, give his opinion and
suggestions.

To make a collaborative working as easy as possible, a few rules should be
obeyed:

1. The used software should be available for everyone, ie. should be free and
   open source, like Gimp and Inkscape.
2. No offensive content. Whoever thinks, that his/her art can only be expressed
   through exorbitant depiction of violence or sexual content is invited to
   challenge their creativity and push it beyond its limit, to find a way and
   express the art in a different way.
3. Add, don't modify or delete. Using layers, it should always be possible to
   contribute to other's work by adding content, without having to delete or
   modify something. Deletion of redundant layers can be performed on request.

That's what I think of right now. Although I don't know if anyone but me will
ever pay attention to this repository, I will update the rules where necessary.
Experience will show what I forgot here.
